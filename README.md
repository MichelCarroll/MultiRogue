After having built using Grunt, to run the server, run **node dist/server/main.js**, and open **dist/client/index.html** in a modern browser.

You might want to open multiple instances of the client in different tabs, and explore having multiple player in the game at the same time.

Controls:
Arrows = Move, 
K = Pick up Object, 
Click Object in UI = Drop Object

Everything takes an action, including moving, picking stuff up, dropping things, and chatting.

(Server should be up... please ping me if it ever goes down)
