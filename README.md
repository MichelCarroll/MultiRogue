
Multirogue Project
==================

Multirogue is a multiplayer roguelike game developed uniquely for browsers. The gaming environment is always organic, randomely generated, making
the gameplay emergent and spontaneous. It has a focus on cooperation and competition. Being turn-based, strategy and careful planning is king.

Development
-----------

The game is currently in its very early stages. If you want to follow it, you can keep an eye out on the development log at http://michelcarroll.com/category/multirogue/. 

If you want to join its development, you can send me (MichelCarroll) a private message on Github to see how best to get involved.

Build Instructions
------------------

After having built using Grunt, to run the server, run **node dist/server/main.js**, and open **dist/client/index.html** in a modern browser.

You might want to open multiple instances of the client in different tabs, and explore having multiple player in the game at the same time.

Controls:
Arrows = Move, 
K = Pick up Object, 
Click Object in UI = Drop Object

Everything takes an action, including moving, picking stuff up, dropping things, and chatting.
